This is a demo file for testing the Java Text Editor functionality.

Here are some sample lines with different patterns:
- Line 1: This contains the word "test" multiple times. Test, TEST, test.
- Line 2: Another line with some text to search through.
- Line 3: Regular expressions like \d+ can match numbers: 123, 456, 789.
- Line 4: Whole word matching should distinguish between "cat" and "catch".

Some repeated words for testing:
- cat
- catch
- category
- scattered

Numbers for regex testing: 42, 100, 999, 2023

Mixed case testing:
- Hello World
- HELLO WORLD
- hello world
- HeLLo WoRLd

This file demonstrates various search patterns that can be used with:
1. Case sensitive/insensitive searching
2. Whole word matching
3. Regular expression patterns
4. Find and replace operations

You can test replacing "test" with "example" or using regex to find all numbers.
The undo/redo functionality will let you revert changes easily.

Cut, copy, and paste operations work with selected text.
Try selecting some text and using Ctrl+C, Ctrl+X, and Ctrl+V.

Features to test:
- Undo (Ctrl+Z) and Redo (Ctrl+Y)
- Find (Ctrl+F) and Replace (Ctrl+H)
- Line and column tracking in status bar
- File type detection (this file uses Unix line endings)
- Read/write permissions display

Java Text Editor keyboard shortcuts:
- Ctrl+N: New file
- Ctrl+O: Open file
- Ctrl+S: Save file
- Ctrl+F: Find text
- Ctrl+H: Replace text
- F3: Find next
- Ctrl+A: Select all
- Ctrl+T: Open terminal
